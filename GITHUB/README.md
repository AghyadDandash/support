# GITHUB - ACCOUNT AND BASIC FOLDER STRUCTURE  
Please follow the steps bellow to create a Github account and set up your work repository for PowerCoders

<br>

## A. Create a [Github account](https://github.com/join)

We will create together a Github account for each one of you, in class, the first day<br>
If you are not present and you want to catch up, please go to directly to [Github Join page](https://github.com/join) and create an account on your own. If confused, follow [^1] the steps on [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub)

*Note: If you already have an account on Github, jump to the next section* 

<br>

## B. Create a new repository
Follow the steps in this page [Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) in order to create a new repository named **`powercoders`**

*Note: the name **"powercoders"** is important as we will use external links to show your work to other people, so, please keep this name !*

<br>

## C. Create this folder structure INSIDE the "powercoders" repo :
### powercoders
```
   portfolio         (this will hold your personal website)
   support           (this will hold the support files, a clone of a remote folder...)
   workshop          (this is your training folder, create a folder for each subject taught in class !)
      cli            (CLI exercices)
      html-css       (html-css exercices)
      js             (js exercices)
      php            (php exercices)  
      ...            (etc.)
   `README.md        (this will be your global info file, we'll use it for training your "markdown" skills)
```
