## WHAT
Create a [classic Todo List](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/) with [vanilla  JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) first with some basic operations and after, as you go, adding functionnality to have in the end a real world application:
* Create a list
* Add to list
* Change list Item
* Delete a list item
* Toggle list item completed status
* Toggle all items status

In addition to JavaScript code we'll do also some HTML/CSS to style a little bit our app.

<br>

## HOW
Instead of learnig JavaScript basics with abstract examples, will start directly with our Todo App and make better and better "versions" as we go, adding functionnality each time when we learn something new.<br>
There will be 11 versions of our application, more if you want to go further by your own.
